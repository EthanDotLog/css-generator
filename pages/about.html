          <h3>I'm your average nerd with a passion for all things tech and a healthy dose of well... inspired humor. But hey, don't let the jokes fool you – I'm also on a mission to conquer the coding world! You see, I'm in the midst of a career shift, trading in the old routine for the exciting (and sometimes mind-bending) world of programming. Why the change, you wonder? Well, let's just say the call of creativity and problem-solving was too strong to ignore. Plus, the thought of building awesome websites and apps just gets me fired up!<br>The journey's been a wild ride, filled with moments of pure triumph (finally cracking that JavaScript code!) and the occasional faceplant into a syntax error. But the one thing that keeps me going is the sheer <strong>reward</strong> of learning new things. Seeing my code come to life, pixel by pixel, is like witnessing a digital sunrise – pure magic, I tell ya!</h3>

            <h3>And speaking of magic, the internet is overflowing with amazing resources for aspiring coders like myself. If you're thinking about joining the coding crew, check out these epic websites:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/ " target="_blank">The Odin Project: </a>Free, project-based learning that'll get your hands dirty (metaphorically, of course). You dont just follow someone type but actually learn how and why things work. This is my favorite overall!</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/ " target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp: </a>Another free platform packed with interactive challenges and a supportive community.</li>
              <li><a href="https://scrimba.com/ " target="_blank">Scrimba: </a>Learn by doing with interactive coding playgrounds and fun tutorials. Some are free but they do charge for some corses and all assignments.(note: you could just look what the solo project is and do it with no clues)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>These are just a few of the many resources out there, so don't be afraid to explore and find what works best for you. And hey, if you're curious to see what kind of coding shenanigans I'm up to, head over to my GitHub and check out my portfolio! Remember, the coding journey is a marathon, not a sprint, so buckle up, grab your favorite caffeinated beverage, and let's have some fun while we get lost in the sauce and learn!</h3>
